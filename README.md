## Introduction
Developing of medical tools is interesting and high-demand of medical-engineering area. Dayly in different places people get thermal injuries due to accidents, negligence i.e. All of them need surgery, in common cases skin replanting, and designed in this project device is specialized for it.

## Description 
For project I use different CAD systems, depending on stage of developing. I model in SolidWorks. For drawing I use Russian CAD Kompas-3D, because I need drawing created in (ESKD) GOST, firstly, (for manufacturing at domestic factory). 

Now project have been still in progress, and need different improvements.
